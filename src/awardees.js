        text: 'Amazing multi-disciplinary creative from Kigali and all-round cool guy. He joined the party a bit later than the others but it was fun to get swept up in his infectious energy and enthusiasm. I enjoyed experiencing his curiosity and willingness to collaborate, it seems like this is one thing the group shared in common. I‚Äôll be looking forward to more awesomeness coming from him from his homebase in Kigali'

        text: 'I became a big fan of Alice‚Äôs work even before the lab week and was super excited to meet her and hear more about it. Her projects centre around the subtle neo-slavery introduced by cash crop production in Africa and I think she has such a cool, tongue-in-cheek way of critiquing the CFA currency at the centre of this trade. Which makes sense bc she is very hilarious, as you can probably tell from this photo. '

Not only does she have a beautiful, beautiful voice, she also possesses the unique ability to craft emotive and engaging stories that exploit this gift...beautifully. Check out her ‚Äú...And Then I Stopped Caring‚Äù EP and you‚Äôll see what I‚Äôm sayn. Plus she‚Äôs sick with the visuals too...honestly so many talented photographers in this group. One of my highlights of the week was witnessing her spontaneous performance singing into the barrel of an installation resting on the grounds of Red Clay. '

        practice: 'Singer/Songwriter/Producer',
        text: 'I enjoyed encountering this dude‚Äôs curiosity and interest in other people‚Äôs stories, which reflects in the music he makes - a really interesting departure from rap that fuses a whole range of influences, styles and sounds. He carried a mobile recording kit with him the whole week so it‚Äôs easy to see how these spontaneous sounds are birthed. Like many of us he‚Äôs also interested in preserving and honouring the archive/ancestors through his work, by resurfacing and collaborating with African musicians of yesteryear, even post-humously. Going back to go forward vibes, I think it‚Äôs very cool.'

        practice: 'Multidisciplinary Artist/Writer/Curator/Researcher',
        text: 'A super critical thinker and asker of questions who‚Äôs passionate about literature as a means of connecting our ancestral past to our present. Also one of several people in the group with an incredible aesthetic eye and a fantastic taste in music. I really appreciate Keren‚Äôs multidisciplinary approach to artmaking (from jewellery design to crafting dreamscapes); it reflects in the breadth of ideas and interests she‚Äôs able to carry. Be sure to check out her spoken literature/dance collab with Souleymane for the final performance, it‚Äôs sick!'

        text: 'Luamba from Luanda, the only reason he‚Äôs not in this photo is because he took it.  As he did many other amazing shots during the lab week. Like everyone else on this group, the depth of intellectual curiosity this guy has is astonishing; I really enjoyed encountering his idea of serendipitous history, an understanding of the fact that what we consider history is as much a grand total of people‚Äôs lived experiences as it is major events recorded in textbooks. This man is also the life of the party and I know that if we had stayed longer he‚Äôd have shut one or two clubs down üòÅ'

        practice: 'Dancer',
        text: 'The amazing dancer from Ouaga! It was really cool to talk with him and hear his ideas on pushing the boundaries of dance and performance art...for example combining the vegetal sculptures he makes with dance. It was also really cool to see his focus on community and the ways in which he is empowering young people around him through his art. For me it‚Äôs always really fun to see how dancers engage the world with their body and Souleymane was no different. His final performance collaboration with Keren was really cool and is worth checking out.'

        text: 'My reaction to seeing Valu‚Äôs final presentation was sheesh, we have work to do. Very inspired type vibes. There is a lot to learn from how rooted in community his practice is, and from his single-minded focus on creating platforms for liberation. On our final day in Ghana we were fortunate to witness an edition of his Rhythm & Blood series in Jamestown, an intense and committed dance offering that left me feeling in awe of the human impulse to create yet again. I‚Äôm super excited to learn more about community organising from studying his work and hopefully collaborating soon.'
